# Pop Movies

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev

```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.js`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Roboto, a custom Google Font.

## Next steps

- Add better error handling on the server side
- Create a movie not found page and redirect to it when a movie is not found
- Get guidance from client regarding the trailer component

## Testing
I have stubbed a cypress end to end test for the application. To run the tests, run the following command:

```bash
npm run cypress:open

```
